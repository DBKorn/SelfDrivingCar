# SelfDrivingCar
A self driving car with various modes, made with a raspberry pi. All files will be uploaded as I complete them, in whichever order I happen to do so

The modes are/will be: 
  -Line tracking<br/>
  -Obstracle avoiding<br/>
  -Light tracking<br/>
  -Remote control<br/>
  
The allMovements.c file is a library for all the methods that control the car's movements (go forwrds turn right/left etc)
